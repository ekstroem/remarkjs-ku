# xaringan theme

This is my own take on a UCPH template for creating slides using the
[`xaringan`](https://github.com/yihui/xaringan) package. Please note that the `ku.css` and `kutheme.R` files are
frequently updated, so may have changed when downloading the most recent version.

## How to use?

The repository contains the following files:

*   `ku.Rmd` - an example template that can be used as a starting point for creating your own slides using the UCPH theme.
*   `ku.css` - the CSS style file. Needs to be in the directory of the Rmarkdown file, and `ku.css` should be added to the YAML header of your Rmarkdown file. 
*   `kutheme.R` - a file to be sourced to set color scheme and ggplot2 theme.
*   `kulogowhiteq.png` - a PNG file.

As well as

*   `animate.min.css` - a CSS file for transition animations. Only necessary for making transition animations.
*   `sundlogowhiteq.png` - the logo for the Faculty of Health Sciences, UCPH.
