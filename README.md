# remarkjs-ku

This is my own take on a KU template for creating slides using the
`xaringan` package. Note that the `ku.css` and `kutheme.R` files are
tweaked fairly frequently, so be aware if you are downloading a new version.

## How to use?

The repository consists of the following files:

*   `ku.css` - the CSS style file. Needs to be in the directory of the Rmarkdown file, and `ku.css` should be added to the YAML. 
*   `kutheme.R` - a file to be sourced to set color scheme and ggplot2 theme.
*   `kulogowhiteq.png` - a PNG file 
*   `ku.Rmd` - an example template that can be used as a starting point for your own slides.

In addition


*   `animate.min.css` - a CSS file for transition animations. Not strictly necessary except of you want to make transition animations.
*   `sundlogowhiteq.png` - the logo for the Faculty of Health Sciences, KU
